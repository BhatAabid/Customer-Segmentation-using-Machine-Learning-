🛒 Customer Segmentation using Market Basket Analysis (MBA)
This project leverages Market Basket Analysis (MBA) , a powerful data mining technique, to uncover associations between products frequently purchased together. Based on these insights, we perform customer segmentation by analyzing purchasing behavior to group customers with similar buying patterns.

📌 Project Overview
Market Basket Analysis helps businesses understand customer preferences and improve marketing, cross-selling, and store layout strategies. In this project, we use association rule mining to identify frequent itemsets and association rules from transactional data. These insights are then used to segment customers based on their purchase history.

This approach is widely used in retail, e-commerce, and FMCG industries to enhance customer experience and optimize sales strategies.
